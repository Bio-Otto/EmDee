EmDee: A Molecular Dynamics Laboratory
======================================

EmDee is a minimalist library that can perform, in a very efficient way, the most computationally
demanding tasks of classical molecular dynamics simulations:

1. Calculation of pairwise interaction forces, energies, and virials.
2. Building and manipulation of neighbor lists.
3. Scaling and/or translation of atom coordinates and conjugate momenta.

The purpose of EmDee is to serve as a platform to test simulation methods that involve the mechanics
of many atoms, such as different thermostats and barostats, hybrid Monte Carlo algorithms, etc.
